### Enhancements

#### Improved Scrolling Behavior

* The stepper now automatically scrolls to ensure the `current step remains visible`.

* If the selected step exceeds the number of visible steps, the `first step scrolls out of view` to maintain focus on the latest step.

* `Smooth animation (30ms, ease-in-out)` added for a better user experience.

#### Dynamic Line Width Calculation

* The width of lines between steps is now dynamically computed based on `available space`.

* This prevents layout issues when steps don't fit perfectly within the stepper's width.

#### Fixes & Improvements

* `Fixed Color Priority` for `Steps`, `Icons`, and `Lines`

  * `Completed steps now always take priority over` active steps.

  * If a step is marked as completed, it will retain its `completed color`, even if it is the current step.

  * Applied this behavior to:
    * Step circle color (`_getStepColor`)
    * Icon color (`_getIconColor`)
    * Text color (`_getTextColor`)
    *  Connector line color (`_getLineColor`)
